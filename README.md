# ToDo List Project

This is a Todo List project based on the free Watch and Code course by Gordon Zhu. Here is the link: https://watchandcode.com/

I built the project step by step through all the course, then I started to modify my web page adding new styles and functions.

My changes:
- added edit button to each todo li;
- hid edit and delete buttons. Now you can see them only if a todo li is being hovered.
- replace ( ) and (X) with checkbox inputs;
